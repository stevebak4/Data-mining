Data Mining and Recommendation Systems: Exploring Netflix and IMDb Movie Trends.

    This project explores Netflix and IMDb data to analyze content trends and build a movie recommendation system. Visualizations show patterns  
    in movie vs. TV show releases, country of origin, and genre popularity. The recommendation system, based on Jaccard and cosine similarity, 
    uses both Boolean and TF-IDF models to suggest similar movies based on their descriptions.

Title: Text Classification and Feature Extraction in News Articles Using Machine Learning and NLP Techniques

    This project explores the classification of news articles into "True" and "Fake" categories using various machine learning algorithms and 
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. A dataset containing real and fake news articles is pre-processed, including the removal of 
    punctuation, normalization, and the use of bigrams for feature extraction. Models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support    
    Vector Machines (SVM) are applied, alongside advanced techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings with GloVe. The project further integrates 
    Random Forests and experiments with grid search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. Through the use of accuracy, F1 
    score, and cross-validation, the models' performance is evaluated and compared, yielding insights into the effectiveness of different 
    approaches for text classification.
